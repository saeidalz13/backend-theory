# Cryptographic signing

Cryptographic signing, also known as digital signing, is a process used to prove the authenticity and integrity of data, ensuring that the data hasnâ€™t been tampered with and that it was created by the known sender. It involves the use of asymmetric cryptography (public-key cryptography).

## How?

1. Sender hashes the message or the document
2. Sender encrypts the resulting hash using a private key
   - **This is the digital signature**
3. Recipient can verify the signature using senders' public key.

## Digital signatures

- Verify the identity of the people in the conversation
- I have someting that I want to send u but a proof that IIIIIII send it
- The recipient needs a way to know if it was me

### Signer

- We have a thing (doc, file, string)
- Encrypt it with private key -> signature
- Send the signature over the internet

BUT!! The problem is

- what if the doc is too large!
- or actually very very short (Encrytion of "1" with any type and key is "1")

**we're going to insert a Hash Function**

- Any message length to 256 bits for instance (SHA256)
- Maybe we add paddings
- **NOW we can encrypt the hashed value**

### Verifier

- Decrypt the signature with the pubic key
